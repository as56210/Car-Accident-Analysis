My name is Ashish Subedi, and my email is ass152@pitt.edu. The title of my project is “Car Accident Analysis”. The research question I have chosen is “Is it possible to predict when a car accident will occur based on factors such as illumination, weather, road condition, location type, speeding, and speed limit?” This research question is interesting to me because I am a young driver. I started driving at 16 and have some years of experience with driving, but by diving deeper and doing more research, I think I will be able to learn more about accidents and how to possibly avoid them in certain situations. I consider this project useful because it might show more insights on car accidents and how to avoid them (more than just the basic conditions of going too fast on a rainy day). I think drivers of all ages can benefit from this model since anyone can be in a car accident. The more educated and aware people are of unsafe driving conditions, the less accidents there will be on the roads. I think DMVs could also use a model like this for their courses on safe driving and how to avoid accidents. My overall plan is to analyze car accidents in Allegheny County by using a dataset from WPRDC to see what conditions led to the accidents. The data comes from accidents that were reported to the police from 2004 to 2022. I plan to use a regression model to predict the outcome.
